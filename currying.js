/*Currying is a technique used in functional programming where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. The curried function returns a new function for each argument until all the arguments are collected and the final result is produced.

In a curried function, instead of taking all arguments at once, you apply the function partially, creating a chain of functions, each taking one argument. Here's a simple example in JavaScript:

*/

// Non-curried function
function add(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

console.log(add(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6

// Curried function
function curriedAdd(a) {
    return function (b) {
        return function (c) {
            return a + b + c;
        };
    };
}

console.log(curriedAdd(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6

/*Currying allows for more flexible and reusable code, as you can create specialized versions of a function by fixing some of its arguments. Many functional programming languages and libraries support currying, and it can be beneficial in certain scenarios, particularly when working with higher-order functions and function composition.
